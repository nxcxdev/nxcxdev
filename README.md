##  ü¶ù Who is Nico?
hello, I'm Nico and I've always been a passionate of video games and music. I have found in web programming the same satisfaction that I get from playing video games or listening to music, perhaps for me, coding is just like playing a videogame, or more like creating one.

# ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What I'm Currently Working On

i'm currently learning on a Full Stack web-development Bootcamp thanks to Factoria F5, who gave me the opportunity to delve deep into the world of web-development. Also, i've been lately involved in Godot and GDScript, and I'm thinking about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating my own video game.
